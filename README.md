## Problem Description

Our task is to develop a relational database system for a tennis club. The primary focus is on managing member information and club operations efficiently. This includes tracking memberships, court bookings, coaching schedules, and program registrations. The central entitiy of the model Members. The members are related to our membership, court usage, programs, events, etc. Our task is to accurately model the relationship between these entities and their relationships, to generate data to populate the model, and to provide querys that would be useful to managers. We are aiming to provide valuable insights to the managers about the Tennis club and its operations. 
The database should accurately represent the club's structure and services, catering to members of skill levels. Additionally, it should support functions like generating reports, analyzing membership trends, and facilitating communication between staff and members.
The ultimate goal is to create a practical database solution that streamlines day-to-day operations and provides valuable insights to club management for informed decision-making.


## Data Model

Here's an overview of the Tennis Club Data Model:

Membership Management: We offer various membership options, including individual, family, and corporate memberships. Each membership type may have different access levels and privileges within the club.

Court Reservation System: Members should be able to easily book tennis courts for their matches or practice sessions. We may also have provisions for non-members to book courts on a pay-per-use basis.

Tennis Programs and Coaching: We provide tennis lessons and coaching sessions for players of all ages and skill levels. This includes group lessons, private coaching, and specialized training programs.

Events and Tournaments: Our club hosts regular events, leagues, and tournaments throughout the year. This includes intra-club competitions, friendly matches, and larger-scale tournaments open to members and non-members alike.

Pro Shop and Equipment Rental: We have a pro shop on-site offering tennis equipment, apparel, and accessories. Additionally, we may provide rental services for tennis racquets, balls, and other gear.

Facilities Management: We maintain our tennis courts, clubhouse, locker rooms, and other amenities to ensure they are clean, safe, and well-equipped for our members and guests.

Billing and Payments: We handle membership fees, court reservations, coaching fees, and other transactions through our billing system. This includes processing payments, issuing invoices, and managing membership renewals.

Member Communication: We communicate with our members through various channels, such as email newsletters, social media, and our club website. We may also have a mobile app for convenient access to club information and updates.

6. Top Spending Clients (Simple) - This query displays the ID and name for each member who has spent more on average than the average amount spent per person using our various services. This can be useful for target marketing and incentives/ exclusive promotions offered by the club. These customers are more likely to add additional items to their purchase for each transaction, so simple advertisements for pro shop items or another tennis program should be included in all communications. ![Screenshot 2024-03-26 140114](https://github.com/ekmcneice/MIST4610-Group-5/assets/163003264/8cd73c50-33f2-4613-a879-896eaedf737d)

8.  Transaction Revenue Split (Simple) - This query helps break down the total amount of revenue gained for each transaction type charged to our clients.
